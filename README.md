# zea
Matching compression/decompression for algorithms used by Nintendo

Initial support:
- mio0 decompression
- yay0 decompression
- yaz0 decompression

To come:
- compression
- SMSR00

**Note:** the 0 simply means it is for cartridges, but it's so common to include it in the algorithm name that we do anyway.

## What is ZEA?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zea

But speculation is that MIO comes from MarIO, so ZEA is ZEldA (ZDA already has various meanings as an organisation name TLA, so I didn't want to use it)
